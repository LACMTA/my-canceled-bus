# My Canceled Bus Tool

A prototype tool to see if your bus has been canceled.

## Details

Cancelation data from the various bus Divisions (non-Contracted Services) is now being entered into HASTUS and the data is being exported to a JSON file every five minutes.

With this prototype tool, we plan to pull the data at the same frequency and then publish it.  Version 1 is a clone of the [SacRT Alerts Page](https://www.sacrt.com/alerts/tcalerts.aspx) and served to help us understand the data.

## To Do

* Publish the data itself 
* Publish a User Guide with details about each field.
* Visualize the data in various ways and test with users.
  * Show cancelation information by bus stop?
* Let folks know about this data.
